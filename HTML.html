<h1>Git for Windows v2.40.1 Release Notes</h1>

<p>Latest update: April 25th 2023</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>These release notes describe issues specific to the Git for Windows release. The release notes covering the history of the core git commands can be found <a href="https://github.com/git/git/tree/HEAD/Documentation/RelNotes">in the Git project</a>.</p>

<p>See <a href="http://git-scm.com/">http://git-scm.com/</a> for further details about Git including ports to other operating systems. Git for Windows is hosted at <a href="https://gitforwindows.org/">https://gitforwindows.org/</a>.</p>

<h1 id="known-issues" class="collapsible">Known issues</h1>

<ul>
<li>On Windows 10 before 1703, or when Developer Mode is turned off, special permissions are required when cloning repositories with symbolic links, therefore support for symbolic links is disabled by default. Use <code>git clone -c core.symlinks=true &lt;URL&gt;</code> to enable it, see details <a href="https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/wiki/Symbolic-Links">here</a>.</li>
<li>If configured to use Plink, you will have to connect with <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">putty</a> first and accept the host key.</li>
<li>Some console programs, most notably non-MSYS2 Python, PHP, Node and OpenSSL, interact correctly with MinTTY only when called through <code>winpty</code> (e.g. the Python console needs to be started as <code>winpty python</code> instead of just <code>python</code>).</li>
<li><p>If you specify command-line options starting with a slash, POSIX-to-Windows path conversion will kick in converting e.g. "<code>/usr/bin/bash.exe</code>" to "<code>C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin\bash.exe</code>". When that is not desired -- e.g. "<code>--upload-pack=/opt/git/bin/git-upload-pack</code>" or "<code>-L/regex/</code>" -- you need to set the environment variable <code>MSYS_NO_PATHCONV</code> temporarily, like so:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 git blame -L/pathconv/ msys2_path_conv.cc</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Alternatively, you can double the first slash to avoid POSIX-to-Windows path conversion, e.g. "<code>//usr/bin/bash.exe</code>".</p></li>
<li>Windows drives are normally recognized within the POSIX path as <code>/c/path/to/dir/</code> where <code>/c/</code> (or appropriate drive letter) is equivalent to the <code>C:\</code> Windows prefix to the <code>\path\to\dir</code>. If this is not recognized, revert to the <code>C:\path\to\dir</code> Windows style.</li>
<li>Git for Windows will not allow commits containing DOS-style truncated 8.3-format filenames ending with a tilde and digit, such as <code>mydocu~1.txt</code>. A workaround is to call <code>git config core.protectNTFS false</code>, which is not advised. Instead, add a rule to .gitignore to ignore the file(s), or rename the file(s).</li>
<li>Many Windows programs (including the Windows Explorer) have problems with directory trees nested so deeply that the absolute path is longer than 260 characters. Therefore, Git for Windows refuses to check out such files by default. You can overrule this default by setting <code>core.longPaths</code>, e.g. <code>git clone -c core.longPaths=true ...</code>.</li>
<li>Some commands are not yet supported on Windows and excluded from the installation.</li>
<li>As Git for Windows is shipped without Python support, <code>git p4</code> (which is backed by a Python script) is not supported.</li>
<li>The Quick Launch icon will only be installed for the user running setup (typically the Administrator). This is a technical restriction and will not change.</li>
<li>Older versions of the Windows Explorer do <em>not</em> calculate Git for Windows' on-disk size correctly, as it is unaware of hard links. Therefore, it might look like Git for Windows takes up 1.5GB when in reality it is about a third of that.</li>
<li>Git command hints are designed for a POSIX shell, this can lead to issues when using them <strong>as is</strong> in non-POSIX shells like PowerShell, <a href="https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/2785">such as this ticket</a>.</li>
<li>When pushing via the <code>git://</code> protocol, Git for Windows may hang indefinitely. The last console output in this case is typically <code>Writing objects: 100%</code>. Until issue <a href="https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/907">#907</a> is addressed, run this command once as a work-around: <code>git config sendpack.sideband false</code>.</li>
<li><p>Git for Windows executables linked to <code>msys-2.0.dll</code> are not compatible with Mandatory ASLR and may crash if system-wide Mandatory ASLR is enabled in Windows Exploit protection. A workaround is to disable ASLR for all executables in <code>C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin</code>, run in administrator powershell (replace <code>$_.Name</code> with <code>$_</code> to use full path to executable instead of name):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>Get-Item -Path "C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin\*.exe" | %{ Set-ProcessMitigation -Name $_.Name -Disable ForceRelocateImages }</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Alternatively, you can disable Mandatory ASLR completely in Windows Exploit protection.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Should you encounter other problems, please first search <a href="https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues">the bug tracker</a> (also look at the closed issues) and <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/git-for-windows">the mailing list</a>, chances are that the problem was reported already. Also make sure that you use an up to date Git for Windows version (or a <a href="https://wingit.blob.core.windows.net/files/index.html">current snapshot build</a>). If it has not been reported, please follow <a href="https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/wiki/Issue-reporting-guidelines">our bug reporting guidelines</a> and <a href="https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/new">report the bug</a>.</p>

<p>This is a security release, addressing <a href="https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/security/advisories/GHSA-gq5x-v87v-8f7g">CVE-2023-29012</a>, <a href="https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/security/advisories/GHSA-g4fv-xjqw-q7jm">CVE-2023-29011</a>, <a href="https://github.com/git/git/security/advisories/GHSA-v48j-4xgg-4844">CVE-2023-29007</a>, <a href="https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/security/advisories/GHSA-9w66-8mq8-5vm8">CVE-2023-25815</a> and <a href="https://github.com/git/git/security/advisories/GHSA-2hvf-7c8p-28fx">CVE-2023-25652</a>.</p>

<p>As announced previously, Git for Windows will drop support for Windows 7 and for Windows 8 in one of the next versions, following <a href="https://www.msys2.org/docs/windows_support/">Cygwin's and MSYS2's lead</a> (Git for Windows relies on MSYS2 for components such as Bash and Perl).</p>

<p>Also following the footsteps of the MSYS2 and Cygwin projects on which Git for Windows depends, the 32-bit variant of Git for Windows <a href="https://gitforwindows.org/32-bit.html">is nearing its end of support</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Comes with <a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/v2.40.0/Documentation/RelNotes/2.40.0.txt">Git v2.40.0</a>.</li>
<li>In the olden Git days, there were "dashed" Git commands (e.g. <code>git-commit</code> instead of <code>git commit</code>). These haven't been supported for interactive use in a really, really long time. But they still worked in Git aliases and hooks ("scripts"). Since Git v1.5.4 (released on February 2nd, 2008), it was discouraged/deprecated to use dashed Git commands even in scripts. As of this version, Git for Windows <a href="https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/pull/4252">no longer supports these dashed commands</a>.</li>
<li>Comes with <a href="https://github.com/jonas/tig/releases/tag/tig-2.5.8">tig v2.5.8</a>.</li>
<li>Comes with <a href="https://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/bash/NEWS">Bash v5.2 patchlevel 15</a>.</li>

<li>Comes with <a href="https://github.com/GitCredentialManager/git-credential-manager/releases/tag/v2.0.935">Git Credential Manager v2.0.935</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>

<ul>
<li>Some commands mishandled absolute paths near the drive root (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/4200"><code>scalar unregister C:/foo</code></a>), which has been <a href="https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/pull/4253">fixed</a>.</li>
<li>When trying to call Cygwin (or for that matter, MSYS2) programs from Git Bash, users would frequently be greeted with <a href="https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/4255">cryptic error messages about a "cygheap"</a> or even just an even more puzzling exit code 127. Many of these calls <a href="https://github.com/git-for-windows/msys2-runtime/pull/48">now</a> <a href="https://github.com/git-for-windows/msys2-runtime/pull/49">succeed</a>, allowing basic interactions. While it is still not possible for, say, Cygwin's <code>vim.exe</code> to interact with the Git Bash's terminal window, it <em>is</em> now possible for Cygwin's <code>zstd.exe</code> in conjuction with Git for Windows' <code>tar.exe</code> to handle <code>.tar.zst</code> archives. </li>
